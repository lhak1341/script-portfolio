## For AI Agents

If you're an AI working on this codebase, **start with [../CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md)** for critical workflows and common mistakes.

Only consult these detailed docs when you need:
- Deep architecture understanding
- Complete schema reference
- Debugging specific issues
- Config builder usage instructions

## For Humans

These docs explain **how the system works** in detail. They supplement CLAUDE.md which focuses on **what AI commonly gets wrong**.
