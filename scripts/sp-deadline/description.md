> **SP Deadline** provides a one-click solution to submit renders to the Deadline render farm.

# Key Features

- Choose render pools for different rendering needs
- Optimal settings automatically applied based on output type (video vs image sequence)
- Access full Deadline submission dialog when advanced configuration is needed

# Quick Start Workflow

1. Use **After Effects 2024** (required)
2. Queue your render in the **Render Queue** (Ctrl-Alt-0)
3. Configure Render Settings, Output Module, and Output To as you would for local rendering
4. Open **SP Deadline** instead of clicking Render
5. Verify Pool/Secondary settings are appropriate
6. Click **Submit to Deadline**

# Reference

## Pools

- `_ae_2024` — Default pool for standard After Effects renders
- `miele` — Dedicated pool for Miele versioning project renders (Self-help in particular)
